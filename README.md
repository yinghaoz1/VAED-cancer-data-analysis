# VAED-cancer-data-analysis
The project VAED-cancer-data-analysis, an internship project completed at the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre (VCCC), provides a holistic analytical process of analyzing the cancer patient dataset to discover the pattern of cancer patients. The project started by gathering requirements from stakeholders, articulating the question about the cancer disease and cancer patient pattern they would like to know. Before analysing the VAED cancer data, I implemented both visual and programmatic assessment method to identify the quality and tidiness issue as well as used the "Define-Code-Test" method to clean all of the identified issues. After that, I implemented exploratory data visualisation (EDA) on the dataset and summarised the key insights on the Powerpoint slide for the presentation. The slide contains the whole analytical process as well as the key insight and recommendation throughout the project.
